# 2020 Election Data Analysis #
This project is a deep dive into some datasets surrounding the 2020 Election. The first dataset is simply electoral performance for governors, senators, congressmen, and the presidential race. It tracks performance by county, state, andd candidate. The second dataset is about turnout rates separated by state. The third dataset (and by far the largest) tracked tweets where #DonaldTrump, #Trump, #JoeBiden, and #Biden are keywords. This was done with the Twitter API and could be an interesting analysis.

These datasets can be found on Kaggle.com, and I will link them below!
